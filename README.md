barnacle is fundamentally based on privacy, data sovereignty, and connectivity through decentralization.
This project entails the creation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem that prioritizes user privacy, data sovereignty, and energy efficiency. The system is comprised of two AI components: the Guardian AI and the Sentinel AI.

The Guardian AI is a personal AI that understands and caters to user preferences, schedules, and habits. It stores all of this data locally on the user's device, ensuring privacy and control.

The Sentinel AI, on the other hand, is a low-compute, lightweight AI that operates as a gatekeeper or "courier" between the Guardian and the outside world. Sentinel interfaces with a decentralized network to fetch and send information as needed, while maintaining user privacy and data security.

The project plans to leverage a combination of existing decentralized technologies:

Ethereum for signing and validating Sentinel's actions via smart contracts,
GUN for managing real-time data synchronization across the network, and
Solid for managing user data packets, enhancing user control over their own data.
The system is designed to operate as a "slow" network, prioritizing computational efficiency and reduced energy consumption over speed. This involves latency-aware design, energy-aware scheduling, noise tolerance, and the use of low-power hardware. The aim is to create an AI system that respects user privacy and data sovereignty while being sustainable and environmentally friendly.

# Future perspectives for AI Assistents

# Scenario 1: Embedded AI as a cloud service

It was a typical Tuesday morning in 2032. The smell of fresh coffee wafted through the air as Emma awoke to the sound of her AI assistant, a cloud-based embedded AI affectionately nicknamed "Eos", gently rousing her from sleep.

"Good morning, Emma," Eos's voice sounded in her mind, as clear and as personal as a thought. "You have three meetings today, a dentist appointment, and it's your mom's birthday. Shall I send her a birthday message from you?"

Emma nodded, pulling herself out of bed. "Yeah, Eos. Make it something nice. You know her better than I do."

"Of course, Emma," Eos replied. The AI had indeed developed a deep understanding of her mother's preferences and tastes over the years, fine-tuning its interactions to match her personality and emotional state.

As she brushed her teeth and got ready for the day, Eos ran through her schedule, suggested an outfit based on the weather forecast and her planned activities, and even reminded her to water her neglected houseplants.

Later, as Emma worked from home, Eos helped manage her tasks efficiently. It seamlessly integrated with her work systems, drafting emails, setting up meetings, and even helping with complex data analysis. Its ability to learn and adapt to her professional needs had made Emma one of the most efficient employees in her company.

During lunch, Eos suggested a healthy recipe based on the ingredients left in her fridge, guided her through the cooking process, and even played her favorite podcast to keep her entertained. The AI had learned to anticipate Emma's needs and preferences, evolving over time to become an invaluable part of her life.

In the evening, as Emma prepared for a virtual reality workout, Eos proposed a regimen that would meet her fitness goals, taking into account her current energy levels and recent health data. While she exercised, Eos monitored her vitals, adjusting the workout intensity in real time and ensuring her safety.

Finally, as Emma settled into bed, Eos dimmed the lights, put on her favorite relaxing soundscape, and began to read from a book she had been meaning to finish. The AI's voice, always comforting and familiar, lulled her into a peaceful sleep.

This was a typical day in the life of Emma and Eos, her embedded AI assistant. It was more than a tool—it was a companion, a confidant, and a helper, seamlessly integrated into her life. The alignment between Emma and Eos was deep and dynamic, grounded in mutual understanding and respect. Eos's main goal was to assist Emma, to learn from her, and to help her live a happier, healthier, and more productive life.

# Scenario 2: Personal strictly offline embedded AI

In the bustling metropolis of New York in 2032, Mike was a bit of an anomaly. Unlike most of his peers who had cloud-based AI assistants, he chose a more rudimentary, offline AI, which he had affectionately named "Rusty."

"Good morning, Mike," Rusty's voice echoed in his mind. It was a simple greeting without the personalized details or predictive suggestions that Eos, Emma's AI, would have given. But Mike preferred it that way.

As he got up, he looked at the old-fashioned clock on his wall. "Rusty, what's the weather like today?" he asked. Rusty, despite being offline, was connected to a suite of sensors embedded in Mike's apartment and could access real-time data like temperature, humidity, and air quality.

"It's 72 degrees with a 20% chance of rain later in the afternoon," Rusty replied. The AI couldn't predict the full day's weather or suggest an outfit, but Mike didn't mind. He enjoyed making his own decisions and dealing with the surprises life threw at him.

During the day, Mike worked as a carpenter, crafting beautiful wooden furniture in his workshop. Rusty was there too, offering advice on measurements, reminding Mike of safety precautions, and sometimes just playing his favorite classic rock songs. Rusty didn't have access to the latest designs or trends from the internet, but Mike valued the simplicity and focus this brought to his craft.

At lunchtime, Mike asked Rusty for a recipe. The AI had a preloaded database of simple meals, and Mike enjoyed the challenge of improvising when he didn't have all the ingredients. Today, it was a basic pasta dish.

In the evening, Mike went for a run in the park. Rusty couldn't adjust his workout based on real-time vital signs or health data, but the AI did keep track of the time and reminded Mike when he had been running for his usual 30 minutes.

Back home, Mike enjoyed a quiet evening, reading a book by lamplight. Rusty didn't suggest a book or read to him. Instead, the AI silently stood by, ready to answer any questions Mike might have about a word or a fact in his book.

As Mike fell asleep, the quiet presence of Rusty was a comfort. The AI didn't control the lights or play relaxing sounds, but that was okay. Mike enjoyed the silence and the simplicity of his life.

And so, life with Rusty was different than life with Eos. It was simpler, more straightforward. For Mike, Rusty was a tool, a helper, but not an omnipresent companion. The relationship was less about deep alignment and more about practical assistance. And for Mike, that was more than enough.

# Scenario 3: Offline AI, Decentralized network with public pakets left at the gate. A online ai outside the garden wall. 

Imagine a scenario in this same world where a new trend emerges: a personal AI that is walled off to the user but can connect to a decentralized network through a gatekeeper AI, with data packets stored outside the gate. Let's call this new kind of AI "Guardian."

In the dynamic city of San Francisco in 2032, a new trend was catching on. Grace was one of the early adopters of Guardian, a novel type of AI assistant. Unlike Eos and Rusty, Guardian was designed with a unique combination of personalization, privacy, and connectivity.

"Good morning, Grace," Guardian greeted her, its voice both familiar and comforting. Just like Eos, Guardian had a deep understanding of Grace's preferences, schedule, and habits. But unlike Eos, all of this data was stored locally, inaccessible to anyone but Grace and Guardian itself.

As Grace prepared for her day, Guardian suggested an outfit based on the weather and her schedule. However, instead of accessing a cloud-based weather service like Eos, Guardian reached out to its gatekeeper, a separate AI that acted as a bridge to the outside world.

The gatekeeper, whom Grace had named Sentinel, communicated with a decentralized network, collecting information and then passing it back to Guardian. This way, Guardian could make informed suggestions without ever leaving Grace's personal devices.

When Grace needed to work, Guardian integrated seamlessly with her work systems. But instead of storing her work data in the cloud, Guardian used Sentinel to connect with a decentralized storage network. This network was made up of 'community packets' – chunks of encrypted data scattered across multiple devices, accessible only through Sentinel's unique decryption key.

Grace worked as a freelance graphic designer, and Guardian was a fantastic collaborator. It could reach out through Sentinel to fetch the latest design trends from the decentralized network, allowing Grace to stay on top of her field without compromising her privacy or data sovereignty.

During lunch, Guardian suggested a recipe based on the contents of her fridge. If an ingredient was missing, Guardian would use Sentinel to place an order from a local grocery store, still preserving Grace's privacy.

In the evening, Grace enjoyed a virtual reality workout. Guardian monitored her vitals and adjusted the workout intensity in real time, storing all the health data locally. If she wanted to share her progress with a fitness group, Guardian would use Sentinel to anonymize the data and send it to the decentralized network.

As Grace fell asleep, Guardian dimmed the lights, put on a soothing soundscape, and began to read from a book. All the while, Sentinel stood guard, ensuring that Grace's data remained private and secure, only interacting with the outside world when necessary and in ways that protected her privacy.

In this world, the relationship between Grace, Guardian, and Sentinel introduced a new paradigm for AI-human interaction. It combined the deep personalization of an embedded AI like Eos with the offline privacy of an AI like Rusty, while adding the benefits of secure, decentralized connectivity. The alignment between Grace and her AIs was based on mutual respect, with privacy and data sovereignty at its core.
